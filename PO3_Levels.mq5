//|  Every PO3 number from 1 to 19683 has its own checkbox and its   |
//|  own colour. Tick as many as you like; the chart refreshes on    |

//|  Levels come from the workbook's "All PO3" sheet, which is       |
//|  multiplier x 3^power for powers 1..15, divided by the scale     |
//|  divisor.                                                        |
//|                                                                  |
//|  1 is the exception and the only grid off by default. It is      |
//|  3^0, the power the sheet starts one above, and at scale 1 it    |
//|  is every whole number - on gold a line per dollar. That is the  |
//|  floor the nest stands on rather than a level to trade, so it    |
//|  is there to be ticked deliberately, for reading where price     |
//|  sits inside a 3 cell, and not to be left on.                    |
//|                                                                  |
//|  Scale 1 gives whole numbers and is the default: gold levels     |
//|  land on 4374, 4455, 4536 and so on, the sheet's raw figures     |
//|  with nothing to divide. Scale 100 gives the workbook's          |
//|  two-decimal gold form (2799.36, 3542.94).                       |
//|                                                                  |
//|  The two agree. A level m x 3^n / 100 is a whole number only     |
//|  when 100 divides m, because 3^n shares no factor with 100, and  |
//|  m = 100k reduces to k x 3^n. So the scale 1 grid IS exactly the |
//|  whole-number subset of the scale 100 grid: choosing whole       |
//|  numbers drops the fractional levels, it does not move any.      |
//|                                                                  |
//|  Powers of three nest: 27 is a multiple of 9, so every 27 level  |
//|  sits exactly on a 9 level. Ticking both would stack duplicate   |
//|  objects on the same price, so a level is drawn ONCE and belongs |
//|  to the HIGHEST ticked PO3 number that lands on it, taking that  |
//|  number's colour and label. That is the sheet's own rule, "The   |
//|  higher the power, stronger the level". Gold at 4374 divides by  |
//|  every number from 3 to 2187, so it is labelled 2187.            |
//|                                                                  |
//|  It also counts candles from the market open and marks the kihon |
//|  suchi numbers on that count - time levels the way the grid is   |
//|  price levels. The numbers, and why each one is what it is, live |
//|  in PO3_Kihon.mqh. The panel counts the same open on H1, M30,    |
//|  M15, M5 and M1 at once, so the timeframes can be read against   |
//|  each other. Nothing here acts on those numbers; they mark where |
//|  a turn is due, not that one is happening.                       |
//|                                                                  |
//|  When an H4 or an H1 count lands ON a kihon number - a lime row  |
//|  in that panel - the candle carrying the number is itself a      |
//|  kihon candle, and a second block standing beside the panel      |
//|  counts the candles inside it - M15, M5 and M1, as many of them  |
//|  as can reach a kihon number in the time there is, and every one |
//|  of them counted from that candle's own open. That gives the     |
//|  hour a turn is due in a finer count to place it in, rather than |
//|  leaving it as one bar.                                          |
//|                                                                  |
//|  A third block beside those two turns the counts into a          |
//|  timetable. Where the first says where the count stands and the  |
//|  second where it stands inside the candle, this one says WHEN -  |
//|  the clock time each kihon suchi candle of the week opens at, on |
//|  D1, H4, H1, M30 and M15 counted from the week open, and then    |
//|  the ones still in front of you today on H1, M30 and M15. Both   |
//|  lists are held to the numbers 9 to 33, which are the ones a     |
//|  week of those timeframes can actually reach. Times read off     |
//|  real bars where the bars exist; a ~ marks the ones ahead, which |
//|  are projected and skip the weekend but not a broker's daily     |
//|  break.                                                          |

//|  KIHON SUCHI - Ichimoku's basic time numbers, and the candle     |
//|  count they are read against. This section was PO3_Kihon.mqh     |
//|  until the indicator that shared it was removed.                 |
//|                                                                  |
//|  The count is inclusive at both ends: the candle you start from  |
//|  is candle 1, not candle 0. That one convention is the whole of  |
//|  the arithmetic below, so it is worth stating plainly. Two       |
//|  17-spans laid end to end do not make 34, because the last       |
//|  candle of the first span IS the first candle of the second:     |
//|  17 + 17 - 1 = 33. Every compound number is built that way, by   |
//|  chaining simple spans that share their turning candle.          |
//|                                                                  |

//|    76   26 + 26 + 26 - 2   (also 51 + 26 - 1)                    |
//|    129  65 + 65 - 1                                              |
//|    172  65 + 42 + 42 + 26 - 3                                    |
//|    226  76 + 76 + 76 - 2                                         |
//|    257  129 + 129 - 1                                            |
//|                                                                  |
//|  26 is the exception, not 172. Every compound above chains       |
//|  simple spans sharing a candle, so k spans subtract k-1. 26 does |
//|  not come out that way: three 9s chained give 9+9+9-2 = 25, and  |
//|  17+9-1 is 25 as well. Reaching 26 needs either a plain 9+17     |
//|  with no shared candle or 9+9+9-1 with one overlap too few, and  |
//|  neither is the rule. That is expected - 26 is one of the three  |
//|  SIMPLE numbers, and a simple number is a given, not a result.   |
//|  It is a calendar figure that the rule then builds on.           |
//|                                                                  |
//|  An earlier version of this file claimed 172 was the outlier and |
//|  wrote it as the plain sum 65 + 65 + 42. That sum is right, but  |
//|  172 chains perfectly well as 65 + 42 + 42 + 26 - 3: four spans, |
//|  three shared candles. 172 obeys the rule. 26 is the one that    |
//|  does not, and it is the one that never claimed to.              |
//|                                                                  |
//|  Above 257 the series keeps doubling - 257 + 257 - 1 = 513 - but |
//|  a number that large has no meaning on an intraday chart, where  |
//|  even 257 M1 candles is only a little over four hours. The list  |
//|  stops where the classical one stops.                            |
//|                                                                  |
//|  What the numbers are FOR: they are candidate turning points in  |
//|  time, not in price. Counting from a swing, or from the session  |
//|  open, candle 9, 17, 26, 33 and so on are where a move is due to |
//|  change character. They say nothing about direction. Read them   |
//|  against the PO3 grid in PO3_Core.mqh: a kihon suchi candle      |
//|  landing on a 27 or 81 level is time and price agreeing, which   |
//|  is the only reason both files are in this project.              |

//|  This was a separate header while a second indicator shared it.  |
//|  That indicator is gone, so it lives here instead: one file to   |
//|  copy into MQL5/Indicators and compile, with no second file to   |
//|  keep in step with it. PO3_Core.mqh is still separate, because   |

//--- The panel is a ladder of calendar periods, each counted in the candles

//--- down to M5 makes up a day. Every block carries its OWN anchor, which is
//--- the whole point - a week count from the day open would read 1 forever.
//--- The lists are fixed rather than inputs so no block can be pointed at a
//--- period its timeframe does not divide.
//---
//--- M30 is on the week rather than anywhere else because that is where it
//--- fits: a trading week is 240 M30 candles, so the count runs through eleven
//--- of the twelve numbers and stops just short of 257 without ever running
//--- off the end of the list.
//---
//--- H2 is not counted anywhere on the panel. It was on the month and the week
//--- and has been taken off both, so the ladder steps H4 straight to H1 on each
//--- of them. What that costs is the middle of the month: H1 over a month is
//--- 504 candles, so it passes 257 around the first of July and reads "past
//--- 257" for the rest of it, while D1 at 21 candles only ever reaches 9 and
//--- 17, and no remaining row covers a month end to end. That is the trade, and
//--- it is worth knowing before adding a row back.
//---
//--- The year, month and week blocks are FIXED. They are the same counts
//--- whatever period the chart is on, so switching timeframe must not change
//--- what they say - a week is 26 H1 candles in whether you are looking at M1
//--- or D1, and a row that came and went with the chart period could not be
//--- read across a timeframe change.
//---
//--- The day block is fixed too, and runs the whole intraday ladder on every
//--- chart period: H1, M30, M15, M5, then the nested M1 row. It used to
//--- stop at the chart's own period, on the argument that detail finer than the
//--- candles in front of you is a count of something you cannot see. That was
//--- wrong about what the panel is for. The count of M5 candles since the day
//--- open is the same number whatever period you look at it from, and it is
//--- often the reason to look - an H1 chart that shows only its own hour count
//--- hides the three rows underneath it that say where inside that hour the
//--- session has got to. The ladder is now read the same way the year, month
//--- and week blocks are, which is the point of a ladder.
//---
//--- H2 was never in that ladder, and the reason it was kept out is the reason
//--- it is now off the other blocks too. Twelve H2 candles fit in a day, so the
//--- only number it could ever reach here is 9, once, at +16h - and 2:1 nesting
//--- puts that on the same candle as H1 17, M30 33 and M15 65, every single
//--- time, because 2k-1 carries a kihon number onto a kihon number. A row that
//--- fires at an instant three other rows are already marking makes the block
//--- look more agreed with itself without any more agreement being there.
//---
//--- M1 is missing from that ladder on purpose, on every chart period. The M1
//--- row is ALWAYS the nested one, which restarts at each kihon suchi H1 candle
//--- rather than running the whole day - see the nested row in UpdatePanel. A
//--- plain M1 row beside it would read "past 257" from mid-morning on and say
//--- nothing for the rest of the session. That is the one row a chart period
//--- could never have justified either way.
